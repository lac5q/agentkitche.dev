# Phase 24 Plan 02: AuditLogPanel UI Summary

AuditLogPanel React component wired to useAuditLog hook, rendering audit trail entries with severity-colored chips on the Memroos Floor page.

## What Was Built

**useAuditLog hook** (`src/lib/api-client.ts`): Appended after `useAgentPeers`. Calls `GET /api/audit-log?limit=${limit}`, polls every 5000ms via `POLL_INTERVALS.hive`, returns typed entries array.

**AuditLogPanel component** (`src/components/memroos/audit-log-panel.tsx`): Mirrors HiveFeed structure exactly — loading spinner, "No audit events yet." empty state, and a list view with actor (truncated), action chip (severity-colored), target, and relative timestamp columns. Severity color map: info=slate, medium=amber, high=rose. Unknown severities fall back to slate.

**Component tests** (`src/components/memroos/__tests__/audit-log-panel.test.tsx`): 8 tests covering loading state, empty state, list rendering with 3 items, actor/action/target/timestamp content, all three severity color classes, and section header text.

**Memroos Floor page** (`src/app/page.tsx`): Added import and `<AuditLogPanel />` immediately below `<AgentPeersPanel />`.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Commit | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| Task 1: useAuditLog hook + AuditLogPanel component + tests (TDD) | 1aaedde | src/lib/api-client.ts, src/components/memroos/audit-log-panel.tsx, src/components/memroos/__tests__/audit-log-panel.test.tsx |
| Task 2: Wire AuditLogPanel into Memroos Floor page | 3881d26 | src/app/page.tsx |

## Verification Results

- Component tests: 8/8 pass
- Full vitest suite: 945 pass, 5 fail (all 5 are pre-existing db-ingest/recall failures, no regressions)
- TypeScript: 0 errors in files touched by this plan (pre-existing errors in unrelated test files remain)

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Known Stubs

None — AuditLogPanel fetches from live `GET /api/audit-log` endpoint established in Plan 01. No placeholder data.

## Threat Flags

None — all threat surface was accounted for in the plan's threat model (T-24-07, T-24-08 both accepted). React JSX text rendering auto-escapes all string values; no new trust boundaries introduced.
